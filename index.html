<p>Hello, my name is Bushra, and I'm 21 years old. 
I am currently studying Computer Systems Engineering 
at the Arab American University, in my third year of studies. 
I have a strong interest in broadening my knowledge across 
various fields. I enjoy exploring new things, trying different 
cuisines, and volunteering. Developing my personality and striving
 to lead a successful life as a Muslim are important goals for me :) </p>
